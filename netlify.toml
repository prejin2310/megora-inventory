# Use this if youâ€™re deploying a React SPA (React Router) to Netlify.
# Adjust the publish directory to your bundler output:
# - Vite: publish = "dist"
# - CRA:  publish = "build"

  publish = "dist"   # change to "build" if using Create React App

# SPA redirect so deep links like /o/OR-20250824-0001 load index.html
